Q: Why did you make this wiki?

A: I made this wiki to make easier to mod developers and users to connect.

## Mods guidelines
To add a mod, as described before create apull request. If you add any mod, you should:
- create a new directory in /mods or /bootlegs (Depending on the mod) with the name of the mod/bootleg.
  - In the directory, add a file called README.md and (optionally) screenshots of the mod/bootleg.
